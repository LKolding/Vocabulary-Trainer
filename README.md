# A simple CLI vocabulary trainer

Written in python using the included json, random and os modules.

I made this during my re-reading of the Harry Potter series. Realizing my lacking vocabulary of some words I found particulary interesting, I began to jot them down.
I've included a dictionary.json including some words.

I recommend the user to tailor the dictionary for oneself. This can be done manually by editing the json file whose format is self-explanatory, or by using the dictionaryManager.py file.

## Usage:
As there're no 3rd-party libraries involved you can simply and safely run the program without any virtual environment.

Main trainer program:
`python main.py`

The dictionary manager:
`python dictionaryManager.py`
