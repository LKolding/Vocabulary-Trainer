# A simple CLI vocabulary trainer

Written in python using the included json, random and os modules.

I made this during my re-reading of the Harry Potter series. Realizing my lacking vocabulary of some words I found particulary interesting and some aesthetic, I began to write them down.
I've included a dictionary.json including some words. 

I recommend you tailor the dictionary for yourself. This should be done manually by editing the json file whose format is self-explanatory.

## Usage:
As there're no 3rd-party libraries involved you can simply and safely run the program without any virtual environment, as so:
`python main.py`
